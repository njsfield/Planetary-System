## Synopsis

A CSS animation for my website. 
Uses SVG animations to display an illustration over the course of several seconds, then cycle through ‘HTML/CSS/JS’ text.
The styles are embedded, so the page can be loaded into the html page of another website using an iframe element.

## Goal

Add classes so that external stylesheets can animation colours.
Minify the html file


## Installation

Download zip
Open planetary-system in your favourite text editor.
The .svg file has been modified with custom id’s on groups, but is available to view.
